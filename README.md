# Binary-Search-Tree
Its a program the keeps track of a userâ€™s personal collection of a particular type of object.
You can choose what type of object you would like to represent (for example: movies, songs, video
games, figurines etc.) The program will initially load all of the data from a text file, and create a binary
tree structure to store and organize the objects. Program users will have the ability to add new pieces
to the collection, and to search the collection for a specific piece. (There will be no deleting of objects.)
